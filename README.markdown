# Google Closure Linter

A Simple textmate bundle to run the linter, and the fixjsstyle commands within the Editor.

## Requirements

You'll need the python closure\_linter package (# pip install closure\_linter), and that should be it.

## Usage

 - SHIFT + OPTION + CONTROL + A = Run the linter
 - SHIFT + OPTION + CONTROL + Z = Run the Auto-fixer (destructive)
 
As an aside, I chose these keyboard shortcuts because it's easy to mash my hand on my keyboard without contortion.


## Installation

 - Go to ~/Library/Appliction Support/TextMate/Bundles
 - Run: git clone git://github.com/thurloat/GoogleClosure.tmbundle.git
 - Open TextMate -> Bundles -> Reload Bundles
